*Features:*

1. Randomly generates math questions with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Asks user for input and checks if the answer is correct.
3. Keeps track of score and displays final score at the end.
4. Allows user to play again.

*Educational benefits:*

1. Practices mental math skills.
2. Improves understanding of basic arithmetic operations.
3. Enhances problem-solving abilities.

*Tips for teachers/parents:*

1. Adjust the difficulty level by changing the range of numbers.
2. Focus on specific operations (e.g., only multiplication) for targeted practice.
3. Encourage students to explain their reasoning behind their answers.
